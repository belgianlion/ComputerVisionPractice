# Computer Vision Practice

This repository exists as a time capsule of my work that taught me to be the developer I am today! It is home to any code I have written that relates to computer vision using OpenCV. The first project `horizon-detection` was made for deployment on the 2022-2023 UMass Rocket Team's payload system. The other projects `finding-lanes` and `hand-detection` were created when I was in middle or high school, and were based around tutorials mentioned in the [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements) section of this readme.







## Acknowledgements

This repository also houses all of the code I wrote in Middle and High School to learn OpenCV and Python. These are based off of tutorial projects that I modified to learn more about the inner functionings of this library. The tutorials used were:

## `finding-lanes`:

## `hand-detection`:

*   `HandVolumeControl.py`:
    * [2] Murtaza’s Workshop - Robotics and AI, “Gesture volume control | OPENCV python | computer vision,” YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEPzbG-xLE (accessed Nov. 4, 2023).
